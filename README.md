# Piece.One

The world is already full of borders, headlines, and noise.
We don’t need another place to argue.

Piece.One is a shared map of the world,
where anyone can drop an emoji or a small piece of feeling.

No likes to chase.
No sides to pick.
Just moments placed on a map —
sometimes funny, sometimes quiet, sometimes strange.

Here, locations aren’t defined by power or conflict,
but by what people choose to leave behind.

We believe expression doesn’t have to be loud to be seen.
And connection doesn’t have to be serious to be real.

So we drop emojis, not bombs.
And we let the world react.
